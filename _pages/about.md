Indiscriminate access to secure, sustainable, and affordable energy is not a privilege; it is a right. My research and career are dedicated to making this a reality through the advancement of electrical power systems.

large power system stability
------

My primary field of research is in large power system stability, including 
but not limited to: modal analysis, propagative EMT simulation, and the convergence of power flow.

graph signal processing
------

GSP is an emerging field that extends DFT to non-trivial topologies. Notably, power system engineers inadvertently contributed to this field gaining traction through developments in sparse network dynamics. 


engineering education
------

There is a deficit of modern educational tools used by instructors in electrical engineering. Modern animation tools and software can be used to illuminate the student experience, reach broader audiences, and bring clarity to age-old analysis.
