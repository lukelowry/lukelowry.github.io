The Spectral Graph Wavelet Transform (SGWT) and Graph Signal Processing (GSP) is a vital part of the bleeding edge research being done on the power grid.

An extensive amount of time was spent to ensure the research and associated code is well documented, open-source, and sustainable.
- [Documentation](https://sgwt.readthedocs.io/) via readthedocs
- Available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/sgwt/)
- Source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/lukelowry/sgwt)

The `sgwt` package is free to use to accelerate your research.
