The Blackout USA project was originally authored by Dr. Adam Birchfield. Through our feedback from the first outreach program, we learned how to enrich the existing application, and make it more accessible.

Each subtation dialogue allows users to startup, shutdown, or change the dispatch of generation and load. They must learn what decisions prevent a blackout.

The project is packed with Accesibility features, including optional keybindings that allow players to operate the grid through only the keyboard.
